# Solution for Running Prisma Seed with `ts-node`

This document outlines the steps taken to resolve the errors encountered when running the `pnpm prisma:seed` command.

## The Problems

There were two main issues:

1.  **`ts-node` Compiler Options Error**: The original script in `package.json` passed compiler options as a JSON string. This caused a syntax error because the shell did not parse the quotes correctly.

    ```json
    "prisma:seed": "ts-node --compiler-options {\"module\":\"CommonJS\"} prisma/seed.ts"
    ```

2.  **Path Alias Resolution Error**: After fixing the first issue, `ts-node` could not resolve the import path `"@/app/generated/prisma"` in the `prisma/seed.ts` file. This is because the `@/*` path alias defined in the main `tsconfig.json` is intended for the Next.js application and is not automatically recognized by `ts-node` when running scripts from the command line.

## The Solution

The solution involved two key changes:

### 1. Dedicated TypeScript Config for Prisma

To resolve the compiler options issue reliably, a dedicated TypeScript configuration was created for Prisma scripts at `prisma/tsconfig.prisma.json`.

This file extends the main `tsconfig.json` but overrides the `module` type to `CommonJS`, which is what Prisma's script-based tooling expects.

**`prisma/tsconfig.prisma.json`:**
```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS"
  }
}
```

The `prisma:seed` script in `package.json` was then updated to use this new configuration file via the `--project` flag, which is a much cleaner approach:

**`package.json` (updated script):**
```json
"prisma:seed": "ts-node --project prisma/tsconfig.prisma.json prisma/seed.ts"
```

### 2. Using a Relative Path for the Prisma Client

To fix the path alias error, the import statement in `prisma/seed.ts` was changed from using the `@/` alias to a direct relative path.

This ensures that `ts-node` can locate the generated Prisma Client without needing to understand the application's specific path mappings.

**`prisma/seed.ts` (updated import):**
```typescript
// Before
import { PrismaClient } from "@/app/generated/prisma";

// After
import { PrismaClient } from "../app/generated/prisma";
```

These changes resolve the errors and allow the Prisma seed script to run successfully.
